# dynalist_to_csv
Turns dynalist flashcard-style notes into csv format (for e.g. anki)

MUST add a file into src/ called "api_token.py", of the format:

TOKEN = 'api_token_from_dynalist_developer_tools_goes_here_(not this string)'

TODO:
- add funcitonality to swap $$ $$ -> \( \) - to enable latex code to work from dynalist to anki
